# Creating a Directory Structure in Angular
In this assesment, we will create a Directory Structure(file-explorer), which will provide a desktop Like Folder Managment enviornment in angular, Where we can create and traverse between directories & subdirectories in a SPA.


![angular-file-explorer]https://github.com/1kingsachinsingh?tab=repositories



Basic Operation Performed by this SPA-
1) Create Folder
2) Back/Up Button
3) Navigate Easily Between present folder and subfolder in UI.
4) Show current working directory in Top.

Also, we take a look at how dumb components can help us re-using our components and keep them independent from the actual file-api of the backend.
